What is QuickTime and how does Vital use it?
</h2>

<p>
QuickTime is a multimedia framework developed by Apple Inc. capable of handling various formats of digital video, media clips, sound, text, animation, music, and several types of interactive panoramic images. Available for Classic Mac OS, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows operating systems, it is the software that allows us to actually play the videos in Vital on your computer.
</p>

<p>
QuickTime 7 or later is required to view the videos in VITAL. Please check your computer for this software and its version, and if necessary download a free version of QuickTime from <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/" target="_blank">Apple's QuickTime Web site</a>. Please refer to <a href="http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/services/quicktime.html" target="_blank">this QuickTime help page</a> to test the player and learn more about it.
</p>

<p>
The videos may vary in quality depending on your network connection and how dated the source video is. In general, the more bandwidth you have, the smoother the videos will play, and the more recent the footage and format, the clearer the image will be.

<h2 style="margin: 30px 0 10px 0;">Getting Started With Quicktime for <A HREF=#Windows>Windows</A> and <A HREF=#Macs>Macs</a></h1>

<p>QuickTime is available in two forms: QuickTime Player and QuickTime Pro.  QuickTime Player is a free, downloadable application that allows you to view QuickTime multimedia on your computer.  QuickTime Pro is a paid upgrade which unlocks media creation and editing functions to QuickTime Player.  It is only necessary for you to have QuickTime Player to view multimedia on your computer.
</p>

<p>
You will need to have the most recent version of QuickTime Player in order to hear and view the media files on this site. If you have never used QuickTime or need to install it, here are some tips to help you get started.
</p>
<p>
NOTE: You will only need to the free QuickTime Player, not QuickTime Pro, in order to access multimedia files.

<h2 style="margin: 30px 0 10px 0;"><A Name="gettingstartedwindows">Windows</A></h1>

<p>
In most cases, QuickTime Player does not come preinstalled on Windows computers. To download the most recent version of QuickTime, please visit the <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/mac.html/"TARGET="_blank">Quicktime Homepage</a>. Your PC must meet the following requirements to run Quicktime:

<ol type="a">
<li>Pentium processor-based PC or compatible computer
<li>Windows 2000/XP
<li>At least 128MB of RAM
</ol>
<p>
In order for Web video to operate properly on your PC, the following settings must be verified:
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>From the Start menu, go to 'Contol Panel'.
<li>Select 'QuickTime'.
<li>From the 'Browser' tab, select 'Play movies automatically'.
<li>From the 'Streaming' tab, select 'Automatic' form the Streaming Speed drop down menu and 'Enable Instant-On'.

<li>From the 'Advanced' tab, select 'Automatic' form the Transport Setup drop down menu.
</ol>
<p>
<h2>Updating QuickTime Player</h2>
</p>
<p>
If you already have QuickTime Player on your computer but are not sure if it is the latest version, there is an easy way to both check and upgrade at the same time without downloading an entirely new version:
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Be sure that you are connected to the Internet.
<li>From the Start menu, go to 'Control Panel'.
<li>Select 'QuickTime'.
<li>From the 'Update' tab, select 'Update or install Apple QuickTime software'.
<li>To make sure you are notified of future QuickTime upgrades, you can select the box for 'Check for updates automatically'
</ol>

Troubleshooting QuickTime on Windows and "Switching Transports"
</h2>

<p>
On Windows computers, QuickTime streaming can be affected by the firewall settings on your personal computer. This problem can be diagnosed if your QuickTime plug-in within VITAL presents a "Switching Transports" message, followed by no immediate playback of video materials.
</p>

<p>
If you suspect that your firewall is preventing access to streaming video clips, try configuring your computer in either of these two alternative ways:
</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><a name="sysrec"></a>
Method 1: Windows Firewall
</h2>


<p>
QuickTime streams are typically transported via the RTP/RTSP protocol, but many firewalls (including the Windows XP Firewall) often block these protocols.  These ports settings can be changed in 'Control Panel > Windows Firewall' panel:
</p>
<p>
* Click on the 'Exceptions' tab, and continue to select 'Add Port'.  Proceed to add the ports and port information specific to QuickTime:
</p>

	<ol type="a">
        <li> Open port 80 for RTSP/TCP data
        <li> Open port 554 for RTSP/TCP data
        <li> Open ports 6970 through 6999 (inclusive) for RTP/UDP data.
    </ol>

<p>
Alternatively, you may also choose to make your default web browser an excepted program, as well.  simply click the selection box for your web browser.
</p>


<h2 style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><a name="sysrec"></a>
Method 2: QuickTime Settings
</h2>


	<ol type="a">
       <li> From the Start menu, select Control Panel.
       <li> In the Control Panel, find and double click the icon for the 'QuickTime'.        <li> Select the 'Advanced' tab.
       <li> Find the 'Streaming' panel, and the drop down menu next to 'Transport Setup'.
       <li> Change drop down selection from 'Automatic' to 'Custom'.  Here, tell QuickTime to use 'HTTP', port '80'.
       <li> Select 'OK'
       <li> If the problem persists, repeat the above steps, but alternately use 'UDP', port 554.
    </ol>
<p>
If the problem is not resolved by any of the above steps, please contact ccnmtl-vital@columbia.edu

Video Viewer
</h2>

<p>
The <b>Video Viewer</b> allows you to watch videos and take notes on specific segments of the videos that you select ("clips").

Your clips will be saved so that you can return to them for subsequent viewings.
</p>

<p>
When you take notes, you must set a start and end time for the clip to which the notes will be attached. You must provide a title, and you can take notes and/or add "tags" to the clip.
</p>

<h3 style="margin: 10px 0 10px 0; font-style: italic;"><a name="makeclip"></a>
Making a video clip

	<li>When you have identified the beginning of your segment, click the "Set start" button. When you have identified the end of your segment, click the "Set end" button. (You can also simply type the time codes into the boxes next to the buttons.) Use the video playhead (the round button in the video progress bar) to jump to different points in the video.</li>
	<li>Enter a title. Be sure to create a title that will help you remember the clip later.</li>
	<li>(Optional) Write notes about the clip. These notes will be saved with your clip.</li>
	<li>Click "Save" to store your clip. Your clip will appear in the "My Clips" list located on the right side of the video viewer. </li>
